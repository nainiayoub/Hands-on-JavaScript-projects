# The Moroccan Vibe 
This project is __The Moroccan Vibe__ website that I have build from scratch using the templating language __Handlebars__.
# Motivation
Handlebars is a client-side templating engine that allows you to build semantic templates. In this project, templating with Handlerbars allowed me to :
* Create simple, easy to read, and reusable template.
* Implement the major steps of using Handlebars in a project.
* Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
