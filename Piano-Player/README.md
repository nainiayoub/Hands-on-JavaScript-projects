# Piano Player #
This project is a single web site page representing a __Piano__ in which the visitor would be the __Player__.
# Motivation #
In this project you will be able to create a Piano Player with DOM events, just like I did, in JavaScript. You'll get familiar with the following : 
* Implementing Firing Events with Piano logic.
* Event Object Properties.
* Keyboard events.
